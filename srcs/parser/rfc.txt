 IRC messages are always lines of characters terminated with a CR-LF
(Carriage Return - Line Feed) pair, and these messages shall not
exceed 512 characters in length, counting all characters including
the trailing CR-LF. Thus, there are 510 characters maximum allowed
for the command and its parameters

If the server encounters a fatal error while parsing a message, an error must be
sent back to the client and the parsing terminated.  A fatal error
may be considered to be incorrect command, a destination which is
otherwise unknown to the server (server, nick or channel names fit
this category), not enough parameters or incorrect privileges.

If a full set of parameters is presented, then each must be checked
for validity and appropriate responses sent back to the client.  In
the case of messages which use parameter lists using the comma as an
item separator, a reply must be sent for each item.
